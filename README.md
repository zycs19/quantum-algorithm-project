# quantum-algorithm-project
New algorithms to improve efficiency and stability for the time-propagated quantum simulation
The algorithms are for the time-propatation of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation (TDKS) 
which is used in the real-time time-dependent functional theory calculation (RT-TDDFT).
